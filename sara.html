            <h3>Why did we decide to solve the issue of spacecraft in this track?!</h3>
             <p style="font-family: Times New Roman;">  Astronauts suffer from psychological and health problems as a result of the environment around them:</p>
             <p style="font-family: Times New Roman;">    ▪︎First :While living and working in space is mentally exhausting, the absence of gravity makes working in a spacecraft without any physicalcompensation.
              The only way to reduce muscle is intense exercise with a proper diet. </p> 
               <p style="font-family: Times New Roman;">  ▪︎ Second: our ships are too slow 
              It is known that the spacecraft is swinging in space, there is no friction to slow it down or anything like that, but the reason for the slowness is due to this principle
              "The larger an object’s mass, the more force it takes to move it". 
              Therefore, we need a large thrust capable of increasing the speed of this spacecraft</p>

                <h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman;">  The solution to the problem of muscular dystrophy that astronauts suffer from is to provide sports equipment to exersice and  activate the muscles daily
                    To develop sports equipments and make them more useful, we put (piezoceramic) that is the most important types of piezoelectric which is a natural physical phenomenon exhibited by some materials, particularly crystals such as quartz and some types of ceramics  which have the ability to generate an electric potential difference when subjected to mechanical stress.  Whereas, if the surface of the material is strongly pressed, a separation of electrical charges occurs across the crystal lattice of the material, and as a result of the separation of charges, an electrical potential difference is produced on both ends of the material. 
                    We used piezoceramic in particular because it is the highest in quality and lowest in price.</h3>

                <h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> Since spaceships need large thrust forces to increase their speed, we decided to use plasma for two reasons
                    The first reason: increasing the speed by relying on the radio waves coming from the sun (sustainable and clean energy) to turn neon or argon gas into plasma
                     Magnets would then push the plasma out as thrust.
                    The second reason : using it instead of nuclear energy because the nuclear energy is a toxic</h3>

            <div class="content">
                <h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman;">  there is another way_to increase the speed of spaceships_ by using solar sail which is  large, thin sheets of plastic attached to a spacecraft and designed so that sunlight can push on them.
                    The process depends on the idea of ​​​​resisting Earth's gravity by taking advantage of the sun's gentle rays, and the idea depends on reflecting the photons of light falling on special plates, which generates movement in this plate according to Newton's third law in the opposite direction</h3>

                        the first purpose is scientific research and verification of edp steps.
                       first, we searched for the problems facing space, and then we identified the problem that we will solve, which is muscle atrophy that astronauts are exposed to and how to increase the speed of the spacecraft.
                       then we analyzed the previous solutions and produced new solutions to these problems
                       for the problem of muscular dystrophy, astronauts need sports equipment and we have provided them with piezoceramic, a type of piezoelectric.
                       for the spacecraft's slowness problem, we equipped it with a solar sail and using plasma instead of nuclear energy
                       as for the radiation problem to which astronauts are exposed, we have used magnesium diboride which works to deflect the charged particles  coming from cosmic rays.
                       the second purpose is to collect information on a website to facilitate obtaining and obtaining information in an organized manner </h3>h3>
